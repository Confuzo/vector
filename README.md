# Introduction #

This project implements a sequence container with a static array.
This project is a starting point to implement other data structure.
We demonstrate the following features
    - the use of classe to create the data structure,
    - the application of templates to pass in the container size and the data type to be stored in the container, and
    - the creation of an internal class `iterator`/`const_iterator`, tha provides access to the containers elements and at the same time warrants compatibility with STL's algorithms.


# Supported Operations #

The array data structure supports insertion at any location, and recovery of information also at any location.
